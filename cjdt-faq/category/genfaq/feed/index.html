<p>As discussed with the clerks, the future plan is for CCH/OBTS and CJDT to be submitted in one XML transmission. To that end, FDLE is working to define the reporting elements for both reports ensuring that the data requirements do not conflict.<br><br>Initially however, CJDT will be a separate transmission in XML while CCH/OBTS will continue to be reported in the pipe delimited format. The data dictionaries for each reporting will also be separate as the rules for elements may differ.<br><br>For example, bond-related elements are unique to CJDT and are not in the CCH/OBTS Dictionary. Addtionally, OBTS Dictionary allows for final action values that are not valid in CJDT since CJDT does not contain juvenile information.</p>

<p>The Florida Legislature created s. 900.05 and s. 943.6871, Florida Statutes, establishing a framework for an expanded criminal justice data collection and sharing that became known as a Criminal Justice Data Transparency (CJDT) initiative. The new legislation requires contributors to provide defined criminal justice data and statistics to FDLE, and directs FDLE to maintain this data and to provide access to it in a modern, open, electronic format, readily accessible through FDLEâ€™s public website. The CJDT contributors are the clerks of court, state attorneys, public defenders, county detention facilities, the Florida Department of Corrections, Justice Administrative Commission (JAC), and criminal regional conflict counsel.</p>



<p>The goal of CJDT initiative is to increase public visibility of criminal justice processes throughout the state. Free and easy access to this data educates the public about how criminal justice processes are handled in each county and what resources are devoted to each of these processes. CJDT also provides policymakers with the data they need to make informed policy decisions and to evaluate how effectively their policy decisions are being implemented.</p>
