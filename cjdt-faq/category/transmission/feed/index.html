		<title>For Clerk data elements, should transmissions be one report containing all data elements with information related by IDs and associations? Or, should there be multiple transmissions per one core relationship like a person, case or other element?</title>

<p>FDLE is working with the vendor to determine how the reports can be submitted. For example, should the SAO (or other entity) send all the data related to a defendant when a change is made, or can the submission be grouped. The victim information requested by CJDT may not change throughout the case, but charge details do. Likewise, some charges in a case resolve more quickly than others. As these design decisions are made, information will be shared.</p>

<h2>Full Question</h2>



<p><strong>For each report, should agencies report a data snapshot, or a full data history for each element reported?<br><br>For example, if the Clerk is reporting charges in a particular case in report 1, and in report 2 an additional charge is added, should the Clerk report only the additional charge, or all of the current charges as of that date? The concern is that some data may be overwritten.</strong></p>



<h2>Answer</h2>



<p>The IEPD Master Documents discuss the use of Insert, Delete and Replace. Additional information will be shared when available.</p>

<p>In short, yes, annual data elements can be sent in a separate report from other elements and are only expected once annually.</p>



<p>To elaborate, based on the IEPD design, elements can be segmented even further based on availability. The full details are available in the CJAdmin Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD). The Master Document identifies the minimum property sets (i.e. required data elements) as well has how data can be sent. The County Corrections Annual Report message has a cardinality of 0-1 for most elements. That means that a “report” can be submitted with the data available at the time. Elements with nulls are not reported and should instead be omitted from the generated XML report provided they are not required.</p>



<p>For example, if by August 1, the June 30 officers and inmate data is not available, it should be omitted from the August report and sent at a later date. If on September 1, those elements are available they can be transmitted using a Delete/Insert report transaction code.</p>



<p>The samples in the IEPD documentation show all elements associated with a report. The cardinality identifies the data that can be segmented and later sent using the Delete/Insert transaction code.</p>

<p>Today, the clerks send data (for OBTS/CCH) when there are changes to the reporting elements. Their case management systems identify, through various criteria, if a record is eligible for reporting. For example, is it the right case type, are the minimum required elements available, etc. The evaluation includes new records as well as modified records. Some systems use changes in system dates to make this determination. Others use more complex logic and some require user action. The result is that “active” cases are reported through their lifecycle. Since the future goal is for Clerks to use a single XML submission stream to report CJDT as well as OBTS/CCH data, this type of selection criteria may continue.<br><br>For other contributors, the recommendation is for agencies to make trigger determinations based on their workflows. For example with State Attorneys, the decision points at case initiation, filing and closure may be reasonable points in time.<br><br>Recommendations for reporting triggers are welcome.</p>

<h5>Full Question</h5>



<p><strong>For integrated case management systems (CMS), i.e. where there is one source for multiple agencies, is it necessary to have separate transmissions per agency? Or can data for all those agencies be aggregated in one report and sent in a singe transmission?</strong></p>



<h5>Answer</h5>



<p>Each agency will need to submit thier own transmission as mandated by the bill. The data will also need to comply with the message formats identified in the IEPDs.</p>



<p>The CJAdmin IEPD contains examples and FDLE is working to add additional examples.</p>

<p>Data submission timing is flexible allowing agencies to have the opportunity to send data in near-real time, daily, monthly, etc. This flexibility will allow agencies and FDLE to consider technical issues like file generation complexity and network traffic based on frequency. At a minimum, submissions are expected monthly. For the daily workload statistics, a separate XML report is expected for each day of data. Agencies can schedule the files to be generated and shared with FDLE daily, generated and shared monthly or generated but shared on a different schedule.</p>
