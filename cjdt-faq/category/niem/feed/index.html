<p>In short, yes, annual data elements can be sent in a separate report from other elements and are only expected once annually.</p>



<p>To elaborate, based on the IEPD design, elements can be segmented even further based on availability. The full details are available in the CJAdmin Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD). The Master Document identifies the minimum property sets (i.e. required data elements) as well has how data can be sent. The County Corrections Annual Report message has a cardinality of 0-1 for most elements. That means that a “report” can be submitted with the data available at the time. Elements with nulls are not reported and should instead be omitted from the generated XML report provided they are not required.</p>



<p>For example, if by August 1, the June 30 officers and inmate data is not available, it should be omitted from the August report and sent at a later date. If on September 1, those elements are available they can be transmitted using a Delete/Insert report transaction code.</p>



<p>The samples in the IEPD documentation show all elements associated with a report. The cardinality identifies the data that can be segmented and later sent using the Delete/Insert transaction code.</p>

<p>With regards to data transparency, it refers to the XML protocol used to transmit data between Florida agencies and FDLE. More information about NIEM can be found on <a target="_blank" href="http://niem.gov/" rel="noreferrer noopener">niem.gov</a>.</p>

Differences in values are sometimes the result of illustrating user itnerface (UI) values versus coded/transmission values.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Both documents are correct and should be used in combination. Differences in values are sometimes the result of illustrating user itnerface (UI) values versus coded/transmission values.</p>
<p>For example with the Domestic Violence (DV) flag: The Yes/No values from DED description/example is what a user would expect to see on a screen in a system, i.e. the UI value. However, the Guide for Use section of the DED shows the actual True/False boolean format type. Technicians should use the True/False values for XML report transmissions.</p>
<p>For code lists, it is different. The XML/XSD contains a superset of codes; every code value may not apply to a system determinded by the reporting requirement. For example, CJDT data is limited to adults (or juveniles treated as adults) while OBTS/CCH data also includes juveniles. The XML/XSD contains a superset of code values that can be used for both CJDT and OBTS/CCH report transmissions. Therefore values like “waived to adult court”, that only apply to juveniles, would be used in transmissions for OBTS/CCH but not in transmissions for a CJDT record.</p>
