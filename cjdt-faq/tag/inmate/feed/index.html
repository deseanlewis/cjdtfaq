<h2>Full Question</h2>



<p><strong>How is the phrase &#8220;total popluation at end of year&#8221; defined regarding inmate counts?<br><br>Is it the total inmate population on 12/31 (snapshot on that date)? Does it correspond to a daily average for an entire year? Or, does it represent the total number of inmates processed in year? (For example, if on 1/1 there are 1000 inmates and one inmate is processed each day, would the total population at the end of the year calculate to 1365?)</strong></p>



<h2>Answer</h2>



<p>Inmate population is another area where clarification from legislative staff was received, included in the Dictionary, and communicated through the conference call(s) established through the Florida Sheriffs Association (FSA).<br><br>Total Population of the County Detention Facility is defined as the “total number of inmates who have been in county detention facilities during the year. The reporting period for this data is July 1 through June 30.” Said differently, this is the number of unique inmates processed in the facility during the fiscal year. Per legislative guidance, this is not an average, nor is it a snapshot.<br><br>Legislative staff also confirmed that daily population is a headcount, not an average. There are no constraints anticipated on the time the County Corrections Daily Report can be provided (using the CJAdmin IEPD). The agencies are allowed to determine when the headcount is taken and reported based on thier business practices, as long as the process is consistent.</p>

<p>Based on legislative direction this is defined as “The total number of adult inmates who have been in the county detention facility while awaiting case disposition during the year”. Expanding on the response above, this element represents a subset of the total inmate population count.</p>



<p>In legislation there are 4 inmate classifications representing subsets of the total count: awaiting case disposition, sentenced to county detention facility, sentenced to Department of Corrections and awaiting disposition in federal court. An inmate&#8217;s classification should reflect the last status that applies.</p>



<p>For example, let&#8217;s say the total population (unique headcount) of inmates is ten. Two of these ten people were arrested on February 1. If, on December 31 one is still awaiting trial, that person would be classified as awaiting case disposition. If the other person’s trial ended on December 1 with an incarceration, that person would be classified as sentenced (to county or FDC as appropriate). If another inmate bonded out (and was not subsequently admitted to serve a sentence) they would be reported as awaiting case disposition. If an inmate who bonded out, was later convicted and re-entered the facility to serve their sentence, they would be classified as sentenced (to county or FDC as appropriate).</p>

<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Full Question: </strong></span></h5>



<p><strong>In regards to reporting inmate/offender data elements, will all inmates booked into a County Detention Facility need to have data elements reported?<br><br>For example, we understand the “Other” type for “Reason for Admission” will include federal detainers or holds for other agencies. However, there are inmates that are remanded from court to serve a sentence that have not been arrested by law enforcement. Are these remands to be classified as an “Other” type for “Reason for Admission,” or are they to be excluded from the reporting data elements all together?</strong></p>



<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></h5>



<p>Inmate specific data (e.g. demographics, arrest and charge details) is expected to be reported for all<br>adult inmates (age 18 or over) or juveniles who are treated as adults, having an episode of criminal activity resuling in an arrest booking. Arrest bookings include all bookings associated with cases and reported to the Supreme Court under §25.075 with one of these 5 reasons of admission:</p>



<ul><li><strong>New Offense Violation</strong> &#8211; includes new violations of law as well as offenders who violate probation, community control, or pretrial release by committing a new offense.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Violation of Probation</strong> &#8211; includes violations of the Widman Act, as well as offenders who violate the terms of probation but do not commit a new offense.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Violation of Community Control</strong> &#8211; includes violations of the Widman Act, as well as offenders who violate the terms of community control but do not commit a new offense.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Violation of Pretrial Release</strong> &#8211; includes offenders in programs as well as offenders with revocation on bond or recognizance but do not commit a new offense.</li></ul>



<p>Use Other for admissions not captured above including holds for federal detainers or inmates awaiting disposition of a case in federal court.</p>



<p>This will typically equate to the booking offenses that have an associated state statute/offense code. There may be inmates in a facility that do not meet this criteria including inmates remanded to serve a sentence, writs of bodily attachment, juvenile pick-up orders, etc. This type of inmate level data would not be reported.</p>



<p>Additionally, the daily, weekly, and annual headcounts (in the CJAdmin IEPD) can include inmates for which charge details are not provided. Reporting for these is only limited to adult inmates (age 18 or over) or juveniles who are treated as adults.</p>



<p>Population headcounts include broader inmate classifications than the inmate/charge details. The population headcounts are further classified into 4 categories: awaiting adjudication, sentenced to the county (remanded), sentenced to FDC or those awaiting federal disposition. These classifications are a limited subset of the population headcount. A facility reporting all these elements should have a the daily population equal to or larger than the sum of the 4 categories. See Appendix C of the detention data element dictionary.</p>
